The purple bars show the direct central bank support via programs such as the euro areaâ€™s Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations. The yellow bars show central bank purchases of sovereign debt.

For the euro area we include purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, and the additional 120 billion-euro purchases announced under the Asset Purchase Program.

Investment in private equity funds is typically by way of commitment (i.e. whereby an investor agrees to commit to invest a certain amount in the fund and this amount is drawn down by the fund as and when it is needed to make private equity investments). Interest in an underling private equity fund will consist primarily of capital commitments to, and investments in private equity strategies and activities which involve a high level of risk and uncertainty. Except for certain secondary funds, private equity funds will have no operating history upon which to evaluate their likely performance. Historical performance of private equity funds is not a guarantee or prediction of their future performance. Investments in Private Equity are often illiquid and investors seeking to redeem their holdings can experience significant delays and fluctuations in value.\r\nIn the US, this material is for Institutional use only â€“ not for public distribution.\r\nIn Canada, this material is intended for permitted clients only, is for educational purposes only, does not constitute investment advice and should not be construed as a solicitation or offering of units of any fund or other security in any jurisdiction.\r\nFor qualified investors in Switzerland, this document is marketing material.

The information presented herein is provided solely as reference material with respect to PEP and its activities. It does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any interests in any PEP fund (each, a â€œPEP Fundâ€ and, collectively, the â€œPEP Fundsâ€). Any such offering will occur only at such time that a private placement memorandum (â€œPPMâ€) of a PEP Fund is made available and only in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the PPM. Prospective investors are strongly urged to review the PPM when available for more complete information (including the risk factors described therein). All information provided herein is qualified by reference to the PPM. There can be no assurance that a PEP Fundâ€™s investment objectives will be achieved and investment results may vary substantially over time. Investment in a PEP Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program for any investor.\r\nPEP is not making any recommendation or soliciting any action based upon the information contained herein. This information is furnished to you with the express understanding that it does not constitute: (i) an offer, solicitation or recommendation to invest in a particular investment in any jurisdiction; (ii) a means by which any such investment may be offered or sold; or (iii) advice or an expression of PEPâ€™s view as to whether a particular investment is appropriate for you and meets your financial objectives.\r\nThe information contained in these materials has been compiled as of August 2020, unless otherwise stated herein. Where the information is from third party sources, the information is from sources believed to be reliable, but none of the PEP Funds, their placement agent, BlackRock, Inc., PEP, PEP Fundsâ€™ advisers or any of their respective affiliates, or the partners, officers or employees (as the case may be) of any of them, has independently verified any of the information contained herein or assumes any liability for it. Additionally, none of these parties is required to provide recipients of this document with updates, modifications, or amendments to the information, opinions, estimates, or forecasts described herein should BlackRock, its affiliates, or any third party sources determine that such currently set forth communication becomes inaccurate.\r\nAny research in this document has been procured and may have been acted on by BlackRock for its own purpose. The results are being made available only incidentally. The views expressed do not constitute investment or any other advice and are subject to change. They do not necessarily reflect the views of BlackRock as a whole or any part thereof and no assurances are made as to their accuracy.\r\nPast performance is not indicative of future results. The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed. You may not get back the amount originally invested. Changes in the rates of exchange between currencies may cause the value of investments to diminish or increase. Fluctuations may be particularly marked in the case of a higher volatility fund and the value of an investment may fall suddenly and substantially.\r\nAll investments risk the loss of capital. No guarantee or representation is made that any private equity investment or fund offered or sponsored by PEP will achieve its investment objective. In addition, there are risks associated with investing in private equity that are not applicable to typical investments in the public equity markets. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: private equity investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk; an investor could lose all or a substantial amount of his or her investment; interests in private equity investments are illiquid and there is no secondary market nor is one expected to develop for interests in such investments or any fund offered or sponsored by PEP; there are significant restrictions on transferring private equity investments; private equity investments experience volatile performance; private equity funds are often concentrated and lack diversification and regulatory oversight; private equity funds have high fees and expenses (including â€œcarried interestâ€) that will reduce such investmentsâ€™ returns and a private equity investment or a fund offered or sponsored PEP may invest in other funds which themselves charge management fees and carried interest (typically, 20% of the net profits generated by the fund and paid to the manager); a private equity investor has an ongoing financial commitment to make contributions to such funds, is subject to severe consequences in cases of default and may have to recontribute distributions to private equity investments; and funds offered or sponsored by PEP can be subject to various conflicts of interest arising from the fact that many private equity sponsors, including BlackRock, are global financial services firms which provide a broad array of financial services and are, in some cases, related to other large financial services firms. Private equity funds may make a limited number of investments. These investments may be in start-up ventures with little or no operating histories or in companies that may utilize significant leverage and will involve a high degree of risk. In addition, a PEP Fund may make minority equity investments where such PEP Fund may not be able to protect its investment or control or influence effectively the business or affairs of such entities. The performance of a PEP Fund may be substantially adversely affected by a single investment. A PEP Fund may obtain rights to substantially influence the conduct of the management of companies in which it invests, including its members serving on the board of directors. This or other measures could expose the assets of a PEP Fund to claims by a portfolio company, its security holders, its creditors and others. Also, private equity investments may be highly leveraged, which increases the risk of investment losses. For a more extensive discussion of the risks associated with an investment in such funds, you should carefully review the â€œCertain Risk Factorsâ€ and â€œPotential Conflicts of Interestâ€ sections of the respective PEP Fundâ€™s PPM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefinitions and disclosures \r\nPlease note that, generally, an investor in a PEP Fund may not transfer, assign, or otherwise dispose of his/her/its interests in such PEP Fund (the â€œInterestsâ€), except with the prior written consent of the general partner of the relevant PEP Fund, which has sole discretion regarding the granting of such consent. In addition, investors who do not fund their capital commitments when due will be subject to severe penalties, including forfeiture of their Interests. Investors should carefully review the relevant PEP Fundâ€™s PPM, when it becomes available, and, specifically, the â€œCertain Risk Factorsâ€ section.\r\nInterests have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the â€œSecurities Actâ€), or any other U.S. or non-U.S. securities laws, will not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless the securities are registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act is available, and will be offered and sold for investment pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and in compliance with any other applicable U.S. and non-U.S. securities laws. The Interests may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Securities Act and any applicable U.S. or non-U.S. securities laws. The Interests have not been recommended by any U.S. federal, other U.S. or non-U.S. securities commission or regulatory authority. Furthermore, the foregoing authorities have not confirmed the accuracy or determined the adequacy of these materials. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. Interests are not insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Company or any government agency, are not guaranteed by any bank and are subject to investment risks, including the loss of the principal amount invested. Investors should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Interests for an indefinite period of time because the Interests (i) cannot be sold unless they are subsequently registered under all applicable securities laws or an exemption from registration exists and (ii) are subject to the restrictions on transfer contained in the limited partnership agreement of the relevant PEP Fund.\r\nPrivate equity investments are less transparent than public investments and private equity investors are afforded less regulatory protection than investors in registered public securities. Private equity funds are sold in private placements and may be offered only to individuals who are both â€œqualified purchasersâ€ (as defined in U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended) and â€œaccredited investorsâ€ (as defined in the Securities Act) and for whom the investment is otherwise suitable.\r\nThere can be no assurance that a PEPâ€™s investment objectives will be achieved and investment results may vary substantially over time. Investment in a PEP Fund is not intended to be a complete investment program for any investor.\r\nOpinions and estimates offered herein constitute the judgment of BlackRock and are subject to change.
